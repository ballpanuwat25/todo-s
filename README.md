# To-Do List Website

This is a simple to-do list website created using React.js and `react-beautiful-dnd` library. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks and mark them as complete. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, which means they persist even after the user closes the website.

-   Create, edit, and delete tasks
-   Mark tasks as complete
-   Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks
-   Cross-platform accessibility
